To run this part of the repository you will need a few packages for the coral board. The steps to install them is as follows:

Step 1: Load edgetpu (the software for coral) on the pi using this link: https://coral.ai/docs/accelerator/get-started/
You will only need to follow the instructions given for Linux. 

Step 2: The above installation does not work directly for RPi 4. This is because it is not on the list of devices in the install.sh 
file. Follow all the steps on the following link to fix it: https://github.com/leswright1977/RPi4-Google-Coral/

Step 3: Plug the coral accelerator into the pi. If it was already connected then unplug and replug.
